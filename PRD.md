🎯 Goal Recap
Platforms: macOS and Windows desktop.

Behavior: Play a chosen sound whenever a key is pressed.

Reference Products:

Mechvibes

Klack

🧰 Technologies to Use
Here are some modern, cross-platform stacks suitable for this:

1️⃣ Electron (JavaScript)
Why?

Cross-platform out of the box.

Easy to bundle with an auto-updater.

Good community examples (Mechvibes uses Electron).

Libraries:

Node.js for system access.

iohook or node-keyboard-hook for global keyboard capture.

Howler.js or Web Audio API for sound playback.

Caveat: iohook sometimes requires native compilation, which can be tricky on Mac (especially M1/ARM).

2️⃣ Python + PyQt or Tkinter
Why?

Fast to prototype.

Good for small utilities.

Libraries:

pynput (global keyboard hooks).

pygame or playsound for audio.

Caveat: Packaging for Mac and Windows is more cumbersome and less polished compared to Electron.

3️⃣ C# (.NET / Avalonia)
Why?

Avalonia is a modern, cross-platform .NET UI framework.

C# has excellent keyboard hook and sound libraries.

Caveat: Slightly steeper learning curve if you’re not a C# developer.

Recommendation
Most indie tools like Mechvibes have found Electron + Node.js to be the easiest sweet spot.

🪜 Logical Steps to Build This App
Here is a step-by-step plan:

Step 1: Plan Core Features
Sound selection (e.g., Cherry MX Blue, Topre).

Global key detection.

Play a sound per keystroke.

Toggle on/off.

Optional: Volume control, profiles.

Step 2: Setup Project
Initialize Electron app:

bash
Copy
Edit
npx create-electron-app mech-keyboard-sounds
cd mech-keyboard-sounds
npm install iohook howler
Ensure packaging tools are in place (e.g., electron-builder).

Step 3: Implement Global Keyboard Hook
Use iohook to capture key events:

javascript
Copy
Edit
const iohook = require('iohook');

iohook.on('keydown', event => {
  // Play sound here
});

iohook.start();
This will fire on all keypresses globally.

Step 4: Sound Playback
Load your sound file(s) using Howler.js:

javascript
Copy
Edit
const { Howl } = require('howler');
const clickSound = new Howl({ src: ['sounds/cherry-mx-blue.mp3'] });

iohook.on('keydown', event => {
  clickSound.play();
});
Pro Tip: Preload multiple variations and pick randomly for more realism.

Step 5: UI Implementation
Simple settings window:

List of sound profiles.

Volume slider.

On/off toggle.

Use Electron’s BrowserWindow to render the UI (HTML/CSS/JS).

Step 6: Packaging
For Windows: electron-builder will create an .exe installer.

For Mac: Sign and notarize your .app.

Step 7: Auto-start on Login
Use auto-launch npm package:

javascript
Copy
Edit
const AutoLaunch = require('auto-launch');

const appLauncher = new AutoLaunch({ name: 'MechKeyboardEmulator' });
appLauncher.enable();
✨ Optional Features to Consider
Per-application sound profiles (e.g., different sounds in VSCode vs. Chrome).

Custom sound uploads.

Overlay showing the active profile.

Latency optimization (preloading sounds).

💡 Tips & Pitfalls
✅ Always preload audio to prevent lag.
✅ Test on both platforms—keyboard hooks behave differently on Mac.
✅ Consider battery usage on laptops (some hooks spin CPU).
✅ If iohook fails on Mac, you can try robotjs or native Node addons (but they are more complex).
